                        Yes, Yes, without the oops! Just my luck, no ice. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Life finds a way. What do they got in there? King Kong? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.</p>

You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

                        You really think you can fly that thing? Just my luck, no ice. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. You really think you can fly that thing? Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.</p>

                    <p>Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.

                        Must go faster. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!
                        
                        God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?</p>
